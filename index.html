            <div><h3>Summary</h3></div>
            <div class="text">This was the final project for an Advanced Java course I took at Greenville Tech. The assignment was to recreate a board game from scratch. I led a team of three and we got 100% on the project.</div>
            <div><h3>In-Depth Look</h3></div>
            <div class="text">The team that I worked on decided to divide the workload up amongst ourselves. One person handled the design of the board using gridpanes and the other person provided general support My primary focus was on the turn logic and functioning of the game. With Aggravation, there are a lot of factors you need to account for on each player's turn - are they able to leave their base, are they able to make a move on the board, are they going to land on an opponent, and so on. I structured the code so that the entire game board was an array with 84 positions.<br>I tracked each player by putting their player number into the array (0-5 for players, 6 being an 'empty' space). When the End Turn button was pressed, the current player value was increased by 1 (to switch to the next player) and then the code ran through the board game array, comparing the value of the position on the board. If the value of the position on the board was equal to the current player, that means the current player has a piece there. It then runs through a series of boolean checks that look for various factors, like opponent positions, piece conflict, etc. From there, these boolean checks are using in a series of If statements that add highlights on the board and click events to allow the player to make their move.</div>

            <div><h3>Summary</h3></div>
            <div class="text">This was the Senior Capstone project for my Computer Science degree at Greenville Tech. I worked with a team of three to create a non-profit website. This included a responsive front-end, an employee back-end, and a database.</div>
            <div><h3>In-Depth Look</h3></div>
            <div class="text">My primary focus on this project was the PHP, where I created everything in a modular approach. We structured this project so that the front-end pulled information from the database and the employee back-end supplied that content. The front-end featured a news section, calendar of events, sign-in and sign-up system, and a donation system, which included a donation history when members were signed in. The back-end featured its own sign-in system and had multiple forms which created news articles and calendar events. The back-end also pulled information from the database, such as member lists and donation histories.</div>
