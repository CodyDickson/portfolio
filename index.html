                <div><h2>Aggravation (Board Game)</h2></div>
                <div class="text">This project was part of an Advanced Java course I took at Greenville Tech. I worked in a team of three to complete this project. My primary focus was on the turn logic. With Aggravation, there are a lot of factors you need to account for on each player's turn - are they able to leave their base, are they able to make a move on the board, are they going to land on an opponent, and so on. I structured the code so that the entire game board was an array with 84 positions.<br> I tracked each player by putting their player number into the array (0-5 for players, 6 being an 'empty' space). When the End Turn button was pressed, the current player value was increased by 1 (to switch to the next player) and then the code ran through the board game array, comparing the value of the position on the board. If the value of the position on the board was equal to the current player, that means the current player has a piece there. It then runs through a series of boolean checks that look for various factors, like opponent positions, piece conflict, etc. From there, these boolean checks are using in a series of If statements that add highlights on the board and click events to allow the player to make their move.</div>
